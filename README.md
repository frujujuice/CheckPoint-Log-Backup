These scripts login to your checkpoint management server and copy the files to your logging server

These scripts require you to have WINSCP installed
Copy all 3 scripts to your logging server and edit usernames and passwords as needed
The ssh-rsa 2048 will need to be obtained from your checkpoint management server
